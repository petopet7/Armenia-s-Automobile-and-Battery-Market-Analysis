The automotive sector in Armenia has changed in
different ways because of global economic shifts, local policy
changes, and technological advances. This paper presents a
detailed market analysis focusing on the import and export
patterns of cars and car batteries, correlating these trends with
the demand and distribution of battery capacities. Utilizing data
from Armenian Statistical Agency 1 and Car Selling Platform 2,
we identify significant market shifts influenced by events such
as the 2008-2009 financial crisis, recent tax adjustments, and the
COVID-19 pandemic. The paper also explores the potential for
setting up a new car battery retail store(s) in Yerevan, examining
optimal store locations, inventory structure, and pricing strategies
based on comprehensive market data and predictive analytics.
The predictions of the marketâ€™s future and geospatial analysis aim
to support decision-making for stakeholders planning to invest
in growing opportunities in the automotive battery landscape in
Armenia.
